## About The Project

![image](./doc/example.png)

This is a GUI for playing chess.
It based on [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame),
and [python-chess](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess).
It's not feature-rich yet, but has all you need to play chess easily

## Setup
- Clone this repo with `git clone`
- `pip install pygame` and `pip install chess`
- Now you should be able to just run the **main.py**

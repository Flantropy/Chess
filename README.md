## About The Project

This is my implementation for the great
game of chess. It's a pet project, and
my first steps in Python. So I concentrate
on usage of **OOP** paradigm, **DRY** and
**KISS** principles. **Pygame** library was
chosen for dealing with all GUI stuff and main
*event loop*. But the game logic was
actual challenge for me. So I done all the
"dirty work" instead of using existing
solution. And Iâ€¯enjoyed it a lot!
